There should be three global variables

The secret number because it gets set when a new game starts and is used to check a user's guess
The game range because it gets set when the user clicks a button and gets used when a new game starts
The number of remaining guesses because it is set for every new game and is changed when a user makes a guess




 How to use the math function to define a new game

def new_game():

    global num_guesses, secret_number

    secret_number = random.randrange(....)
    num_guesses = int(math.ceil(math.log(high-low+1,2)))

above formula will define the number of guesses
7 for range zero to 100
10 for range zero to 1000 


int(math.ceil(math.log(high+1,2)))
the lower limit is aways zero


import math
import random

range_100  = 100
range_1000 = 1000

print int(math.ceil(math.log(range_100,2)))
print int(math.ceil(math.log(range_1000,2)))


if number of guesses is equal to 0 print, you ran outta guesses
if number of guesses is > 0 elif number of guesses == secret number

if int (guess) == secret number then they guessed correctly 
if int (guess) is < secret number then print higher
if int (guess) is > secret number then print lower
