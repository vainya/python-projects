declare wumpus types and assign initial value
create a year counter

make a loop that will stop at some point:  (hint: a while loop is the easiest)
    add the births to both types
    subtract the deaths of both types
    increment the year counter
    print all variables so you can see what is happening inside the loop

after loop finishes print result to screen

while(slow_wumpus > fast_wumpus)

2000 *0.6 same as 2000 * 0.4 -2000
